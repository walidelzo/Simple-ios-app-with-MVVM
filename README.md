MVVM
Model View View-Model design pattern help you to write standard loose coupled code. Your code is divided into model, view & view model.

Model
Also known as data layer. For example name. age, user, music, movie all of these are examples of data.

View
User Interface & gets data from view model. Labels, buttons, text fields, table view etc are example of views. User can see, interact, input in views.
